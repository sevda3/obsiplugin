Core features

By users, for users

We understand that the best recommendations come from those who are actively in the community. That's why our collection is curated by Obsidian users, for Obsidian users. Every plugin featured here has been handpicked by fellow enthusiasts who know just what you need to enhance your workflow.

Up to date

We are always in pursuit of the best experience. New plug-ins are always getting developed, and added to the list of 1,300+ others. You don't need all of them. That's why we're here.

Categorised for you

The best UX plug-in is useless if you're looking for a plug-in to help file management. The internet is difficult to navigate and time is your most valuable resource, so don't waste it doing this alone. We already have categorised all of our collection to help you.

Featured Plug-ins


Why us? Obsidian already has a list of all approved community plug-ins on their site. You are free to CTRL-F and scroll through them, but there are better ways. You could also Google "what is the best obsidian plug-in for [BLANK]" and check Reddit or other forums to hear from real people. But we're already doing all of this for you. A quick look through our catalog can reveal that we're tired of repeating this every time we need a plug-in, and our curation is intended for real human use - including ourselves. We're here if you want to take the easy road.
